# European Soccer Database & Match Prediction Project

Author: Joseph Darby

---

## Overview:
This repository relates to my capstone project for the Data Science Immersion program with General Assembly. 

**GOAL:** Accurately predict the outcomes of individual European football matches with the provided database. The baseline accuracy rate for model comparison is 46%. This percentage represents the rate at which the home-team wins a given match.  

The database has been provided by Kaggle and is quite robust. Although, many of the tables do not share common keys and require careful attention when merging to fully integrate useful information. Overall, the data consists of results from over 25,000 matches and game events across 11 European countries from 2008-2016. Included are the player and team skill rankings scraped from the popular video game, EA Sport's FIFA. Finally, the database contains betting odds from 10 European bet brokers.  

## Important Note:

- The sqlite database file required to start the project is too large to upload to GitHub. You can directly download the database file here:
> https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer#database.sqlite

- Also, some of the resulting CSV files produced by my code are too large to upload as well. You will need to **fork and clone a copy** if this repository thoroughly code along.

The folder structure is numbered to illustrate the sequential process of the project, starting at data gathering and ending with my presentation.
